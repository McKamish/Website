From Ardit's Python Mega Course on Udemy

This is project #4, building a website with Flask.

The form of this class is to walk the student through the steps; thus, all code
if the instructors. I will attempt while doing the lessons to write my own lines,
 but ultimately I will default to using the code as per instruction.
